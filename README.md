<b> To Do: </b>
I really want to coninue to work on this game. I know I can get this material. I'm hitting a wall with these bigger projects, and I notice that they're the same walls I hit with the smaller projects. This week, I am focusing on absorbing as much as I can in class and from my peers. I am also focusing on figuring out how to use my time effectively so that I can hit walls faster, find solutions more effectively and be in a place where I can complete these projects in the given time. I have wins and breakthroughs, but they're not showing up in my projects yet. I'm confident that they will soon.
